requestHook.js
==============

a very simple javascript file that will hook jquery's $.ajax() function allowing all calls to $.ajax(), $.get(), and $.post() to be cloned to another address (Note: this is also essentially example code for how to hook a JS function...)

This was originally written to test [postMonitor](https://github.com/rolandshoemaker/postMonitor).

Example
-------

uuuum. Load it **after** jQuery. That's about it. oh and define clone_addr!
